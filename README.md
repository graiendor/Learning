# PythonLearning
Here I store the projects I've done on my way to mastering Python

## Structure

#### Common Python

Contains my Python learning path. From trivial tasks to the most composite work - **pyth_06**. Here 
a microservice architecture was implemented with gRPC.

#### LeetCode

Contains solutions to algorithmic excercises from LeetCode

#### DataScience

My attempt to data science (which is not my thing)

#### Useful

Contains templates of data structures, solutions and algorithms, that I cherish.
